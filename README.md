This app is a WIP community marketplace.

Currently, the app allows registered users create and modify their own listings, as well as see others' listings

I've added a few of my own listings, the image for which is actualy from the emulated phone's camera

EDIT ASSIGNMENT 3: My app now shows a random featured listing on the home page, and the title is now easier to make out
